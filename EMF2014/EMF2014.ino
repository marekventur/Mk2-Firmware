 TiLDA Mk2

 EMF2014
 This is the entry point for the badge firmware.
 Here we deal with the setup of all the badge features
 This includes:
 Initial Pin States
 Detecting the reset condition (power cycle, button wake from deep sleep, IMU wake from deep sleep)
 Recovering of the config or hibernation file from the Flash
 Restoring context as needed
 Starting the main TiLDATask and the FreeRTOS scheduler
